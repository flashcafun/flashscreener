    The Extension may request certain Chrome permissions (such as context menus, storage, or activeTab) in order to provide its core functionality.  
    These permissions are used exclusively for the features described in the Extension‚Äôs description and are not used to access personal or sensitive data.

  </p>

  <h2>5. User Control</h2>

    The user can uninstall the Extension at any time through their Chrome browser settings.
